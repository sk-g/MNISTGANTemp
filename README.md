# MNISTGANTemp
requires:
matplotlib, seaborn,keras,tqdm.

not actually using seaborn so you can edit to not use it.


run all blocks in MNIST GAN.ipynb and once it finishes, git add *, commit and push!

Thanks for the help. Although, I am not sure if I will be able to use this during the presentations, at least we 
will have hands on with a GAN code. (although there is a slight bug in BatchNorm because of keras2 which I will address after
presentation).
